    Increases the boundary of the mask by one pixel. i.e., adds one layer of pixels around the mask present in the data
    passed in.

    Parameters
    --------------
    data:
        Array with the original shape that we wish to expand
    factor:
        number of pixels that we wish to increase
    fac:
        Used internally

    Returns
    -------
        numpy array:
            Increased image
    Notes
    -----

        This is a recursive function to expand by a number of pixels (factor) our image inside the data array.
        This function muss be refactored since it's inefficient. However, for the time being, the overhead that it introduces
        is not enough to justify optimizing it.
